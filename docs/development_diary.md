# Audiovisual Node Playground Development Diary

**Note: This development diary has been reorganized into separate feature files for better organization.**

Please see the updated documentation structure in the [features directory](features/development_diary.md).

The new structure includes:
- [Project Overview](features/project_overview.md)
- [Core Engine](features/core_engine.md)
- [Node Editor System](features/node_editor_system.md)
- [Visual System](features/visual_system.md)
- [Audio System](features/audio_system.md)
- [Bridge System](features/bridge_system.md)
- [User Interface](features/user_interface.md)

This reorganization makes it easier to track progress on individual features and maintain clear documentation as the project evolves.
