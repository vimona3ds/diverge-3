# Audiovisual Node Playground Development Diary

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a desktop web application where users can create real-time audiovisual experiences using a node-based editor. It leverages techniques like metaballs, reaction-diffusion, feedback loops, and fractal mathematics for visuals, combined with procedural and sample-based audio synthesis through the Web Audio API.

## Current Project Status (As of [Current Date])

The project is in early development with the basic architectural framework implemented. The core infrastructure including the main application layout, engine, node editor system, and basic type definitions are in place. However, specific visual and audio technique implementations (metaballs, reaction-diffusion, granular synthesis, etc.) have not yet been started.

### Environment and Setup
- Basic React application structure is set up with TypeScript
- Webpack configuration is in place for development and production builds
- Core dependencies are installed (React, Three.js, Tone.js, UUID)

## Feature Status

### Core Engine

**Goal:** Implement a core orchestration engine that manages the node graph, processing pipeline, and synchronization between visual and audio systems.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic Engine class implementation

**Notes:**
- The Engine now features a robust error handling system with different recovery strategies (CONTINUE, RETRY, FALLBACK, RESET) for each subsystem.
- Performance monitoring is implemented using a Profiler class that tracks execution times for different operations.
- Memory monitoring is in place to detect high memory usage and trigger cleanup when needed.
- Asset management now includes tracking of asset usage with timestamps and automated cleanup of unused resources.
- The Scheduler has been enhanced with FPS monitoring and control capabilities.
- The Engine's update loop now includes proper error handling and recovery mechanisms to prevent crashes.
- Resource cleanup is implemented for both visual and audio systems with smart detection of unused assets.

### Node Editor System

**Goal:** Create a node-based editor where users can visually connect processing blocks to create complex audiovisual effects.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic Editor implementation for managing nodes and connections
- ✅ NodeFactory for creating node instances
- ✅ NodeEditor React component with basic UI
- ✅ Connection management (creating, deleting connections)
- ✅ Drag and drop interaction for adding nodes
- ✅ Visual feedback for connections
- ✅ Zoom and pan functionality
- ✅ Node component implementations for various node types
- ✅ Undo/redo system
- ✅ Node groups and organization
- ✅ Node parameter controls in the UI

**Notes:**
- The node editor is now much more functional with a node library, context menu, undo/redo support, and proper connection visualization.
- Implemented a flexible NodeLibrary component that categorizes nodes by type for easy selection.
- Added visual feedback for connections with bezier curves and selection states.
- Added zoom and pan functionality with controls for better user experience.
- Implemented undo/redo system for all operations (add/delete nodes, add/delete connections, move nodes, update parameters).
- Added node groups feature allowing users to organize related nodes together with collapsible, resizable containers.
- Implemented full node group functionality including creating, deleting, renaming, moving, resizing, and changing colors.
- Added node parameter UI controls with support for various data types (float, integer, boolean, select, color, and string).
- Parameters can now be adjusted directly within the node UI with appropriate controls based on data type.
- Improved user experience with visual feedback for selections, drag operations, and group management.

### Visual System

**Goal:** Implement a flexible rendering system for various visual techniques (metaballs, reaction-diffusion, etc.) that can be composed through the node system.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic Renderer setup with Three.js
- ✅ ResourcePool implementation for efficient WebGL resource management
- ✅ VisualSystem class that manages the rendering pipeline

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Technique implementations:
  - ❌ Metaball system
  - ❌ Reaction-diffusion system
  - ❌ Lenia (continuous cellular automata)
  - ❌ Feedback loop system
  - ❌ Fractal noise system
- ❌ Shader implementations for each technique
- ❌ Visual node definitions
- ❌ Viewport rendering component
- ❌ Performance optimizations for visual rendering

**Notes:**
- The foundational structure for the visual system exists, but none of the specific visual techniques have been implemented yet.
- Shader directory structure exists but contains no shader files.

### Audio System

**Goal:** Create a flexible audio processing system that integrates with the visual system and allows for procedural and sample-based audio synthesis.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic AudioSystem implementation
- ✅ AudioNodeRegistry for registering audio processors

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Audio technique implementations:
  - ❌ Oscillator nodes
  - ❌ Noise generators
  - ❌ Sample-based audio system
  - ❌ Filter nodes
  - ❌ Effect nodes
- ❌ Audio worklet implementations
- ❌ Sample management and loading
- ❌ Audio node definitions
- ❌ Audio UI controls

**Notes:**
- The audio system has its basic structure in place but lacks all the specific audio node implementations and worklets.
- The initialization flow for audio (requiring user gesture) is implemented in the UI.

### Bridge System

**Goal:** Create a system that synchronizes and maps data between the visual and audio systems.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Directory structure for bridge system

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Visual data extraction
- ❌ Parameter mapping between visual and audio
- ❌ Real-time synchronization
- ❌ Bridge node types
- ❌ UI for setting up mappings

**Notes:**
- The bridge system appears to be one of the least developed parts of the project.

### User Interface

**Goal:** Create an intuitive interface for working with the node system, viewing results, and adjusting parameters.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic application layout
- ✅ Toolbar component
- ✅ Sidebar component for parameter editing
- ✅ CSS for basic styling
- ✅ Audio initialization UI

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Node creation interface
- ❌ Viewport controls (play/pause, reset)
- ❌ Asset management UI
- ❌ Responsive design
- ❌ Theme and visual styling

**Notes:**
- The UI framework is in place with significant improvements to node parameter controls and organization.
- The parameter control system now supports various types including sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, color pickers, and text inputs.
- Node organization is greatly enhanced through the group system, allowing for more complex node networks.

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the current state, here are the recommended next steps in order of priority:

1. **Complete Visual Techniques**: Implement at least one visual technique (metaballs) with shaders to have a visible output.
2. **Complete Audio Techniques**: Implement basic oscillator and effect nodes to have audible output.
3. **Implement Bridge System**: Create the visual-audio synchronization to demonstrate the core concept.
4. **Add Viewport Controls**: Implement play/pause and reset controls for the renderer.
5. **Polish UI**: Enhance the user interface for better usability.
6. **Optimization**: Apply performance monitoring and optimization strategies to ensure smooth operation.

## Technical Observations

- The project follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- The type system is well-defined, following the specifications in the technical design document.
- The node-based approach allows for extension with new techniques without major refactoring.
- The React components and core systems are built to be loosely coupled.
- The project uses modern JavaScript features and TypeScript for type safety.
- The Core Engine is now very robust with comprehensive error handling, performance monitoring, and resource management.
- The Node Editor system has been significantly enhanced with group and parameter functionality, making it more user-friendly.
