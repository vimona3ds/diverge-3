# Audiovisual Node Playground Development Diary

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a desktop web application where users can create real-time audiovisual experiences using a node-based editor. It leverages techniques like metaballs, reaction-diffusion, feedback loops, and fractal mathematics for visuals, combined with procedural and sample-based audio synthesis through the Web Audio API.

## Current Project Status (As of March 28, 2024)

The project is in early development with the basic architectural framework implemented. The core infrastructure including the main application layout, engine, node editor system, and basic type definitions are in place. However, specific visual and audio technique implementations (metaballs, reaction-diffusion, granular synthesis, etc.) have not yet been started.

### Environment and Setup
- Basic React application structure is set up with TypeScript
- Webpack configuration is in place for development and production builds
- Core dependencies are installed (React, Three.js, Tone.js, UUID)
- Jest and ts-jest are set up for unit testing

- Improved type safety and error handling in test files, particularly with FileReader mocking
- Fixed issues with async test execution and proper cleanup between tests
- Added better handling of circular references in the component graph
- Implemented more robust mocking of browser APIs for reliable testing

Several testing challenges have been addressed:
1. **Circular Dependencies**: Fixed circular imports between ErrorHandler and test files by creating local mocks.
2. **Infinite Recursion**: Improved cycle detection in NodeProcessor to prevent stack overflows.
3. **Testing Browser APIs**: Created proper TypeScript-compatible mocks for browser APIs like FileReader.
4. **Asynchronous Tests**: Improved handling of async operations in tests to prevent test contamination.
5. **Mocking Challenges**: Enhanced the mocking approach for complex services and systems.

The Core Engine is now more robust with these fixes, particularly in handling cyclic node graphs and preventing infinite recursion during processing. Continued focus on test improvements will ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the current state, here are the recommended next steps in order of priority:

1. **Complete Core Test Suite**: Finish fixing the test failures in Scheduler and other services to ensure the engine is stable.
2. **Complete Visual Techniques**: Implement at least one visual technique (metaballs) with shaders to have a visible output.
3. **Complete Audio Techniques**: Implement basic oscillator and effect nodes to have audible output.
4. **Implement Bridge System**: Create the visual-audio synchronization to demonstrate the core concept.
5. **Add Viewport Controls**: Implement play/pause and reset controls for the renderer.
6. **Polish UI**: Enhance the user interface for better usability.
7. **Optimization**: Apply performance monitoring and optimization strategies to ensure smooth operation.

## Technical Observations

- **Browser Compatibility**: WebGL2 and AudioWorklet support varies across browsers.
- **Resource Management**: WebGL resources need careful management to avoid memory leaks.
- **UI Complexity**: The node editor requires complex interaction patterns.
- **Testing Challenges**: Mocking browser APIs (especially FileReader, AudioContext) requires careful implementation.
- **Circular Dependencies**: Need to be vigilant about avoiding circular imports between modules.
- **Cyclic Node Graphs**: Must handle user-created circular node connections gracefully.
