# Audiovisual Node Playground Development Diary

The development diary has been split into separate feature files for better organization and clarity.

## Feature Documentation

- [Node Editor System](node_editor_system.md)
- [Visual System](visual_system.md)
- [Audio System](audio_system.md)

- [User Interface](user_interface.md)

This table of contents serves as a guide to navigate through the detailed documentation for each feature of the Audiovisual Node Playground project. Click on the links above to view the specific feature documentation.

I'll continue to update these files as development progresses.
