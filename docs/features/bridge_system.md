**Goal:** Create a system that synchronizes and maps data between the visual and audio systems.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Directory structure for bridge system

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Visual data extraction
- ❌ Parameter mapping between visual and audio
- ❌ Real-time synchronization
- ❌ Bridge node types
- ❌ UI for setting up mappings

**Notes:**
- The bridge system appears to be one of the least developed parts of the project.
