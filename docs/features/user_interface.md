# User Interface

**Goal:** Create an intuitive interface for working with the node system, viewing results, and adjusting parameters.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic application layout
- ✅ Toolbar component
- ✅ Sidebar component for parameter editing
- ✅ CSS for basic styling
- ✅ Audio initialization UI
- ✅ Parameter control components (sliders, color pickers, etc.)
- ✅ Node library browser

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Node creation interface
- ❌ Viewport controls (play/pause, reset)
- ❌ Asset management UI
- ❌ Responsive design
- ❌ Theme and visual styling

**Notes:**
- The UI framework is in place with significant improvements to node parameter controls and organization.
- The parameter control system now supports various types including sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, color pickers, and text inputs.
- Node organization is greatly enhanced through the group system, allowing for more complex node networks.
