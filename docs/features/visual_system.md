## Development Insights:
- Type guards are essential for safe handling of unknown technique objects
- TDD approach was very effective for defining expected behavior before implementation
- Topological sorting algorithm ensures proper node processing order
- The integration layer effectively bridges two complex systems
- Using Maps for output data storage provides efficient lookup
- Careful WebGL resource management is critical to prevent memory leaks
- Proper disposal of resources requires type-safe checks
- Index files help organize and expose components correctly
- Testing THREE.js applications requires careful mocking of WebGL objects
- Helper classes to expose protected/private members are valuable for testing
- Proper cleanup between tests prevents test contamination
- Always add null checks in a waterfall pattern, checking each property level before accessing deeper ones
- When fixing tests, ensure the fixes actually match the real-world usage patterns of the component
- Be particularly careful with WebGL uniform access patterns as they require multiple safety checks
- Edge case testing is vital for robust WebGL applications, especially handling uninitialized states
- Properly structured tests help identify patterns of fragility in the codebase
- Enhancing type safety greatly improves code readability and reduces runtime errors
- Enums provide compile-time safety for string literals, preventing typos and invalid values
- Constraining types with semantic meaning (like NormalizedValue) makes the API more self-documenting
- Adding JSDoc with minimum/maximum value annotations helps both TypeScript and developers
- Creating helper functions for validation centralizes logic and reduces duplication
- Proper type guards enable safe type narrowing in TypeScript, improving code safety

## Issues and Lessons Learned:
- TypeScript type safety requires careful attention, especially with WebGL resources
- The `unknown` type with type guards provides safer handling than `any`
- Circular dependencies between modules can cause subtle issues
- When implementing integration layers, clear interface boundaries are essential
- Testing complex systems requires careful mocking of dependencies
- Maintaining type safety while allowing flexible node connections requires careful design
- Using the proper PortType enum values helps catch type errors at compile time
- Property paths like `node.state.technique.dispose()` need type checking at each level
- Testing visual node integration requires understanding of both systems being connected
- Mocking THREE.js objects requires attention to detail about which methods are called
- Testing edge cases like operations without initialization is important for robust code
- Using test cleanup functions between tests prevents test contamination
- NULL CHECKS ARE CRITICAL: Always check for the existence of objects and properties before accessing them
- When working with external libraries like THREE.js, assume properties might be undefined
- Nested property access (like this.initMaterial.uniforms.u_seed.value) needs multiple safety checks
- Handling uniform mock values in tests requires manual updates since the mocks don't automatically update like real WebGL uniforms
- Exact assertions on call counts (like expecting exactly 11 renders) can be fragile; better to use more flexible expectations
- A function "working" doesn't mean it handles all edge cases - explicit testing of uninitialized states is essential
- When tests fail with different call counts than expected, don't just change the numbers - understand why the calls are different
- Mock implementations need to match the behavior of real objects closely, especially their side effects
- Test expectations should match the actual implementation behavior, not just theoretical behavior
- Understanding the full calling sequence is important when testing complex operations
- Always include tests for handling null and undefined values, especially for properties accessed in a chain
- For WebGL applications, always assume that resources might be disposed of unexpectedly
- Blend modes and shader parameters need comprehensive testing with all possible combinations
- Proper resource cleanup is essential to prevent memory leaks in long-running WebGL applications
- Type safety improvements should focus on semantic meaning, not just basic types
- When adding enums, make sure to update all places that used strings previously
- Type guards should be simple and focused on one task for clarity
- Validation functions should handle invalid input gracefully, with meaningful error messages
- Parameter sanitization is important to maintain valid state even when input is invalid
- Documentation should explain not just what a parameter is, but its valid ranges and effects
