8. Fix remaining issues in visual system tests (e.g., FluidSimulation null reference errors)

## Development Insights:
- Type guards are essential for safe handling of unknown technique objects
- TDD approach was very effective for defining expected behavior before implementation
- Topological sorting algorithm ensures proper node processing order
- The integration layer effectively bridges two complex systems
- Using Maps for output data storage provides efficient lookup
- Careful WebGL resource management is critical to prevent memory leaks
- Proper disposal of resources requires type-safe checks
- Index files help organize and expose components correctly
- Testing THREE.js applications requires careful mocking of WebGL objects
- Helper classes to expose protected/private members are valuable for testing
- Proper cleanup between tests prevents test contamination

## Issues and Lessons Learned:
- TypeScript type safety requires careful attention, especially with WebGL resources
- The `unknown` type with type guards provides safer handling than `any`
- Circular dependencies between modules can cause subtle issues
- When implementing integration layers, clear interface boundaries are essential
- Testing complex systems requires careful mocking of dependencies
- Maintaining type safety while allowing flexible node connections requires careful design
- Using the proper PortType enum values helps catch type errors at compile time
- Property paths like `node.state.technique.dispose()` need type checking at each level
- Testing visual node integration requires understanding of both systems being connected
- Mocking THREE.js objects requires attention to detail about which methods are called
- Testing edge cases like operations without initialization is important for robust code
- Using test cleanup functions between tests prevents test contamination
- NULL CHECKS ARE CRITICAL: Always check for the existence of objects and properties before accessing them
- When working with external libraries like THREE.js, assume properties might be undefined
- Nested property access (like this.initMaterial.uniforms.u_seed.value) needs multiple safety checks
- Handling uniform mock values in tests requires manual updates since the mocks don't automatically update like real WebGL uniforms
- Exact assertions on call counts (like expecting exactly 11 renders) can be fragile; better to use more flexible expectations
- A function "working" doesn't mean it handles all edge cases - explicit testing of uninitialized states is essential
- When tests fail with different call counts than expected, don't just change the numbers - understand why the calls are different
- Mock implementations need to match the behavior of real objects closely, especially their side effects
- Test expectations should match the actual implementation behavior, not just theoretical behavior
- Understanding the full calling sequence is important when testing complex operations
