# Visual System

**Goal:** Implement a flexible rendering system for various visual techniques (metaballs, reaction-diffusion, etc.) that can be composed through the node system.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic Renderer setup with Three.js
- ✅ ResourcePool implementation for efficient WebGL resource management
- ✅ VisualSystem class that manages the rendering pipeline

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Technique implementations:
  - ❌ Metaball system
  - ❌ Reaction-diffusion system
  - ❌ Lenia (continuous cellular automata)
  - ❌ Feedback loop system
  - ❌ Fractal noise system
- ❌ Shader implementations for each technique
- ❌ Visual node definitions
- ❌ Viewport rendering component
- ❌ Performance optimizations for visual rendering

**Notes:**
- The foundational structure for the visual system exists, but none of the specific visual techniques have been implemented yet.
- Shader directory structure exists but contains no shader files.
