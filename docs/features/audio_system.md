# Audio System

**Goal:** Create a flexible audio processing system that integrates with the visual system and allows for procedural and sample-based audio synthesis.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic AudioSystem implementation
- ✅ AudioNodeRegistry for registering audio processors

**Incomplete:**
- ❌ Audio technique implementations:
  - ❌ Oscillator nodes
  - ❌ Noise generators
  - ❌ Sample-based audio system
  - ❌ Filter nodes
  - ❌ Effect nodes
- ❌ Audio worklet implementations
- ❌ Sample management and loading
- ❌ Audio node definitions
- ❌ Audio UI controls

**Notes:**
- The audio system has its basic structure in place but lacks all the specific audio node implementations and worklets.
- The initialization flow for audio (requiring user gesture) is implemented in the UI.
