- ‚úÖ Fixed interface mismatches between implementation and tests

**In Progress:**
- üîÑ Integration tests for Engine with all systems 

**Next Steps:**
- ‚ùå Implement full integration tests for the Engine with all systems

**Notes:**
- The Engine now features a robust error handling system with different recovery strategies (CONTINUE, RETRY, FALLBACK, RESET) for each subsystem.
- Performance monitoring is implemented using a Profiler class that tracks execution times for different operations.
- Memory monitoring is in place to detect high memory usage and trigger cleanup when needed.
- Asset management now includes tracking of asset usage with timestamps and automated cleanup of unused resources.
- The Scheduler has been enhanced with FPS monitoring and control capabilities:
  - Fixed time step for stable simulations
  - Proper frame timing with accumulator pattern
  - Smooth FPS calculation using exponential moving average
  - Protection against "spiral of death" with max delta time
  - Improved frame timing accuracy
- The Engine's update loop now includes proper error handling and recovery mechanisms to prevent crashes.
- Resource cleanup is implemented for both visual and audio systems with smart detection of unused assets.
- Unit testing has been completed for all Core Engine components with comprehensive test coverage.
- All utility classes (ErrorHandler, MemoryMonitor, Profiler) now have thorough tests for their functionality.
- Services (AssetManager, Scheduler) have been fully tested including edge cases and error handling.
- Recent improvements to core systems:
  - NodeProcessor now has full type safety with generic port types
  - Profiler supports nested mark tracking with parent-child relationships
  - ErrorHandler features structured stack traces and error relationships
  - All systems use proper TypeScript types with no implicit any
  - Performance optimizations in data structures (Map, Set)
  - Better memory management with size limits
  - Improved error reporting with detailed stack traces
  - Support for async error listeners
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities with self-time tracking in profiler
  - More accurate performance metrics with proper statistical analysis

Latest improvements (as of April 17, 2024):
- Enhanced Engine.test.ts with correct mocking of component systems
- Updated Engine.ts to include proper initialization of the AssetManager
- Added initialize call to AssetManager in the Engine initialization sequence
- Implemented proper mocking of initialize methods in test files
- Improved test structure with direct mocking of systems in the engine instance
- Added proper lifecycle test for the Engine to verify start/stop functionality
- Added assertions to check proper initialization of systems during Engine startup
- Improved test coverage for Engine initialization and shutdown
- Set up proper system sequences for initialization in Engine.ts, including assetManager.initialize() and scheduler.initialize()
- Made mocks consistent with the required interface in tests

Latest fixes (as of April 18, 2024):
- Added missing `initialize()` method to the AssetManager class that returns a Promise
- Added missing `initialize()` method to the Scheduler class
- Added errorHandler.dispose() call to the Engine's dispose method
- Updated the Scheduler's requestNextFrame() method to use global.requestAnimationFrame for better testability
- Fixed the Engine lifecycle test by properly mocking the Scheduler to ensure the requestAnimationFrameSpy is called
- Fixed all TypeScript errors in Engine.ts related to initialization methods
- Made API consistent between mock implementations and actual components
- All test suites now pass successfully without any errors

The Core Engine feature is now in a robust state with proper initialization sequences, error handling, and consistent interfaces across all systems. The tests are structured properly, with mocks that accurately reflect the actual implementation. The next step is to implement comprehensive integration tests between the Engine and all subsystems to ensure they work together seamlessly in a variety of scenarios.
