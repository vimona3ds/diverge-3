# Node Editor System

**Goal:** Create a node-based editor where users can visually connect processing blocks to create complex audiovisual effects.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Basic Editor implementation for managing nodes and connections
- ✅ NodeFactory for creating node instances
- ✅ NodeEditor React component with basic UI
- ✅ Connection management (creating, deleting connections)
- ✅ Drag and drop interaction for adding nodes
- ✅ Visual feedback for connections
- ✅ Zoom and pan functionality
- ✅ Node component implementations for various node types
- ✅ Undo/redo system
- ✅ Node groups and organization
- ✅ Node parameter controls in the UI

**Notes:**
- The node editor is now much more functional with a node library, context menu, undo/redo support, and proper connection visualization.
- Implemented a flexible NodeLibrary component that categorizes nodes by type for easy selection.
- Added visual feedback for connections with bezier curves and selection states.
- Added zoom and pan functionality with controls for better user experience.
- Implemented undo/redo system for all operations (add/delete nodes, add/delete connections, move nodes, update parameters).
- Added node groups feature allowing users to organize related nodes together with collapsible, resizable containers.
- Implemented full node group functionality including creating, deleting, renaming, moving, resizing, and changing colors.
- Added node parameter UI controls with support for various data types (float, integer, boolean, select, color, and string).
- Parameters can now be adjusted directly within the node UI with appropriate controls based on data type.
- Improved user experience with visual feedback for selections, drag operations, and group management.
